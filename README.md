  - Description: Reduces drag, retaining speed better.
  - Tiers: 1, 2, 3 -> Multiplier for velocity decrease when climbing goes down (lower rate of decrease)
- Rocket Science
  - Description: Uncovers the power of rocketry! Hold space to boost.
  - Tiers: 1, 2, 3 -> more fuel
- Durability
  - Description: Hazards affect the plane much less.
  - Tiers: 1, 2, 3 -> Reduce slow-down/stun duration
- Landing Gear
  - Description: Unlocks the ability to bounce off the ground once.
  - Tiers: 1, 2, 3 -> Increase the recovery height
- Design
  - Description: Improve the efficiency of your plane
